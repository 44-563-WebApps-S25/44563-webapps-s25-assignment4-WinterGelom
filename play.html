            SCENE I. Windsor. Before PAGE's house.
            Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS
            SHALLOW
            Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.
            SLENDER
            In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and 'Coram.'
            SHALLOW
            Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.
            SLENDER
            Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born, master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'
            SHALLOW
            Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.
            SLENDER
            All his successors gone before him hath done't; and all his ancestors that come after him may: they may give the dozen whit luces in their coat.
            SHALLOW
            It is an old coat.
            SIR HUGH EVANS
            The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agress well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.
            SHALLOW
            The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.
